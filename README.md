# Fashion Recommendation System

![Fashion Recommendation System](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=Fashion+Recommendation+System)

## Overview

The **Fashion Recommendation System** is a machine learning project designed to recommend fashion items based on user preferences and historical data. Leveraging techniques like Random Forest classification, PCA, and SVD, this project aims to provide personalized recommendations while ensuring scalability and efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Joblib
- **Data Management**: Pandas, DVC (Data Version Control)
- **Environment Management**: requirements.txt for dependencies

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion_recommendation_system.git
   cd fashion_recommendation_system
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:

Place the fashion_mnist.csv dataset in the data/ directory.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Data Sources
The dataset used for this project is the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples of clothing items. You can access the dataset here.

Model Training
The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier to predict clothing item categories based on features extracted from the dataset. The training pipeline includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Training: Using the train_model function from model_training.py.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model performance using accuracy and classification reports.
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Deployment
The project is designed to be easily deployable. The Flask application serves the model predictions and recommendations through a user-friendly interface.

Running the App
Once the app is running, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the interface and see model predictions.

Future Improvements
Implement user authentication for personalized recommendations.
Incorporate additional algorithms such as collaborative filtering for enhanced recommendations.
Expand the dataset to include more diverse fashion items.
Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements.
